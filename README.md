## Trees

- ### Trees - Notes & Background
    - basic tree construction
    - traversal
    - manipulation algorithms
    - [ ] [BFS(breadth-first search) and DFS(depth-first search) (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWL6FJhq5fM)
        - BFS notes:
           - level order (BFS, using queue)
           - time complexity: O(n)
           - space complexity: best: O(1), worst: O(n/2)=O(n)
        - DFS notes:
            - time complexity: O(n)
            - space complexity:
                best: O(log n) - avg. height of tree
                worst: O(n)
            - inorder (DFS: left, self, right)
            - postorder (DFS: left, right, self)
            - preorder (DFS: self, left, right)

## Sorting

- [ ] Notes:
    - Implement sorts & know best case/worst case, average complexity of each:
        - no bubble sort - it's terrible - O(n^2), except when n <= 16
    - [ ] stability in sorting algorithms ("Is Quicksort stable?")

        - [Sorting Algorithms - Stability](http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~leon/cs-mcs401-s08/handouts/stability.pdf)
    - [ ] Which algorithms can be used on linked lists? Which on arrays? Which on both?
        - I wouldn't recommend sorting a linked list, but merge sort is doable.
        - [Merge Sort For Linked List](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort-for-linked-list/)

## Graphs

Graphs can be used to represent many problems in computer science, so this section is long, like trees and sorting were.

- Notes:
    - There are 4 basic ways to represent a graph in memory:
        - objects and pointers
        - adjacency matrix
        - adjacency list
        - adjacency map
    - Familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons
    - BFS and DFS - know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code
    - When asked a question, look for a graph-based solution first, then move on if none.

- I'll implement:
    - [ ] DFS with adjacency list (recursive)
    - [ ] DFS with adjacency list (iterative with stack)
    - [ ] DFS with adjacency matrix (recursive)
    - [ ] DFS with adjacency matrix (iterative with stack)
    - [ ] BFS with adjacency list
    - [ ] BFS with adjacency matrix
    - [ ] single-source shortest path (Dijkstra)
    - [ ] minimum spanning tree
    - DFS-based algorithms (see Aduni videos above):
        - [ ] check for cycle (needed for topological sort, since we'll check for cycle before starting)
        - [ ] topological sort
        - [ ] count connected components in a graph
        - [ ] list strongly connected components
        - [ ] check for bipartite graph

- ### Dynamic Programming
    - You probably won't see any dynamic programming problems in your interview, but it's worth being able to recognize a problem as being a candidate for dynamic programming.
    - This subject can be pretty difficult, as each DP soluble problem must be defined as a recursion relation, and coming up with it can be tricky.
    - I suggest looking at many examples of DP problems until you have a solid understanding of the pattern involved.

## System Design, Scalability, Data Handling

**You can expect system design questions if you have 4+ years of experience.**

- Scalability and System Design are very large topics with many topics and resources, since
      there is a lot to consider when designing a software/hardware system that can scale.
      Expect to spend quite a bit of time on this.
- Considerations:
    - scalability
        - Distill large data sets to single values
        - Transform one data set to another
        - Handling obscenely large amounts of data
    - system design
        - features sets
        - interfaces
        - class hierarchies
        - designing a system under certain constraints
        - simplicity and robustness
        - tradeoffs
        - performance analysis and optimization

    - flow:
        1. Understand the problem and scope:
            - define the use cases, with interviewer's help
            - suggest additional features
            - remove items that interviewer deems out of scope
            - assume high availability is required, add as a use case
        2. Think about constraints:
            - ask how many requests per month
            - ask how many requests per second (they may volunteer it or make you do the math)
            - estimate reads vs. writes percentage
            - keep 80/20 rule in mind when estimating
            - how much data written per second
            - total storage required over 5 years
            - how much data read per second
        3. Abstract design:
            - layers (service, data, caching)
            - infrastructure: load balancing, messaging
            - rough overview of any key algorithm that drives the service
            - consider bottlenecks and determine solutions

## Coding Question Practice

Now that you know all the computer science topics above, it's time to practice answering coding problems.

**Coding question practice is not about memorizing answers to programming problems.**

Why you need to practice doing programming problems:
- problem recognition, and where the right data structures and algorithms fit in
- gathering requirements for the problem
- talking your way through the problem like you will in the interview
- coding on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer
- coming up with time and space complexity for your solutions
- testing your solutions

There is a great intro for methodical, communicative problem solving in an interview. You'll get this from the programming
interview books, too, but I found this outstanding:

## Your Resume

- See Resume prep items in Cracking The Coding Interview and back of Programming Interviews Exposed

## Be thinking of for when the interview comes

Think of about 20 interview questions you'll get, along with the lines of the items below. Have 2-3 answers for each.
Have a story, not just data, about something you accomplished.

- Why do you want this job?
- What's a tough problem you've solved?
- Biggest challenges faced?
- Best/worst designs seen?
- Ideas for improving an existing product.
- How do you work best, as an individual and as part of a team?
- Which of your skills or experiences would be assets in the role and why?
- What did you most enjoy at [job x / project y]?
- What was the biggest challenge you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What was the hardest bug you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What did you learn at [job x / project y]?
- What would you have done better at [job x / project y]?

## Have questions for the interviewer

    Some of mine (I already may know answer to but want their opinion or team perspective):

- How large is your team?
- What does your dev cycle look like? Do you do waterfall/sprints/agile?
- Are rushes to deadlines common? Or is there flexibility?
- How are decisions made in your team?
- How many meetings do you have per week?
- Do you feel your work environment helps you concentrate?
- What are you working on?
- What do you like about it?
- What is the work life like?
- How is work/life balance?

- ### Balanced search trees
    - Know at least one type of balanced binary tree (and know how it's implemented):
    - "Among balanced search trees, AVL and 2/3 trees are now passé, and red-black trees seem to be more popular.
        A particularly interesting self-organizing data structure is the splay tree, which uses rotations
        to move any accessed key to the root." - Skiena
    - Of these, I chose to implement a splay tree. From what I've read, you won't implement a
        balanced search tree in your interview. But I wanted exposure to coding one up
        and let's face it, splay trees are the bee's knees. I did read a lot of red-black tree code.
        - splay tree: insert, search, delete functions
        If you end up implementing red/black tree try just these:
        - search and insertion functions, skipping delete
    - I want to learn more about B-Tree since it's used so widely with very large data sets.
    - [Self-balancing binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree)

    - **AVL trees**
        - In practice:
            From what I can tell, these aren't used much in practice, but I could see where they would be:
            The AVL tree is another structure supporting O(log n) search, insertion, and removal. It is more rigidly
            balanced than red–black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval. This makes it
            attractive for data structures that may be built once and loaded without reconstruction, such as language
            dictionaries (or program dictionaries, such as the opcodes of an assembler or interpreter).

    - **Splay trees**
        - In practice:
            Splay trees are typically used in the implementation of caches, memory allocators, routers, garbage collectors,
            data compression, ropes (replacement of string used for long text strings), in Windows NT (in the virtual memory,
            networking and file system code) etc.

    - **Red/black trees**
        - these are a translation of a 2-3 tree (see below)
        - In practice:
            Red–black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time.
            Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications,
            but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures which provide worst-case guarantees;
            for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red–black trees, and
            the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red–black trees. In the version 8 of Java,
            the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor
            hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used.

    - **2-3 search trees**
        - In practice:
            2-3 trees have faster inserts at the expense of slower searches (since height is more compared to AVL trees).
        - You would use 2-3 tree very rarely because its implementation involves different types of nodes. Instead, people use Red Black trees.

    - **2-3-4 Trees (aka 2-4 trees)**
        - In practice:
            For every 2-4 tree, there are corresponding red–black trees with data elements in the same order. The insertion and deletion
            operations on 2-4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red–black trees. This makes 2-4 trees an
            important tool for understanding the logic behind red–black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce
            2-4 trees just before red–black trees, even though **2-4 trees are not often used in practice**.

    - **B-Trees**
        - fun fact: it's a mystery, but the B could stand for Boeing, Balanced, or Bayer (co-inventor)
        - In Practice:
            B-Trees are widely used in databases. Most modern filesystems use B-trees (or Variants). In addition to
            its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary
            block in a particular file. The basic problem is turning the file block i address into a disk block
            (or perhaps to a cylinder-head-sector) address.

## Additional Detail on Some Subjects

    I added these to reinforce some ideas already presented above, but didn't want to include them
    above because it's just too much. It's easy to overdo it on a subject.
    You want to get hired in this century, right?
